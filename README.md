# Academic-research-how
This repository is for some reading materials and most importantly, how I do academic research as a MSc student. 
## Why doing research?
I am a MSc student, having done quantitative research in gamification and industrial management, for optimisation like groubi. I decide to have a master degree in ESG management cause I like learning and make friends along the way. Writing and reading don't bother me at all, even so I would create my own little page on github just as you are looking right now.
